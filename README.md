# Telecom Churn Prediction

Saturday, April 18, 2021

## About

This notebook is my exercise of creating ML classification model for the anonymized dataset of one of the US large Telecom providers. 
The intention was to study why customers churn, find potential causes and develop the model to predict whether a given customer will churn, and propose the solution to reduce the churn rate.

Detailed analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook file.
